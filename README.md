# Task 1: Interface with a stock price data feed
Financial Data, Python, Git, Basic Programming

You’ve been asked to assist with some development to add a chart to a trader’s dashboard allowing them to better identify under/over-valued stocks.

The trader would like to be able to monitor two historically correlated stocks and be able to visualize when the correlation between the two weakens (i.e. one stock moves proportionally more than the historical correlation would imply). This could indicate a potential trade strategy to simultaneously buy the relatively underperforming stock and sell the relatively outperforming stock. Assuming the two prices subsequently converge, the trade should be profitable.

Most data visualization for our traders is built on JPMorgan Chase's Perspective data visualization software, which is now open source. If you want to explore that, a link is provided in the resources section. 

Before implementing this request using perspective, first you’ll need to interface with the relevant financial data feed and make the necessary adjustments to facilitate the monitoring of potential trade opportunities.

* Understanding the finance and trading part is not required.

* Being familiar with python scripting language and command line basics is not required as you will be guided in this exercise

* (Note, you DO NOT have to install Perspective as an individual software onto your machine. All you need to complete this task is to follow the instructions in step 3)

# Task 2: Use JPMorgan Chase frameworks and tools
React, Typescript, Web Applications

ypically, traders monitor stock prices and trading strategies by having data displayed visually on their screens in chart form. Often these charts will be accompanied by alerts that notify users when certain events occur or when preset price thresholds are hit.

JPMorgan Chase created the Perspective tool over many years to allows users to present and manipulate data feeds visually in web applications.

Perspective provides a set of flexible data transforms, such as pivots, filters, and aggregations. It utilizes bleeding-edge browser technology such as Web Assembly and Apache Arrow and is unmatched in browser performance. It is engineered for reliability and production-vetted on the JPMorgan Chase trading floor and is now available to the development community as Open Source. If you want to explore that, a link is provided in the resources section. 

* Understanding the finance and trading part is not required for this task.

* Being familiar with python scripting language, command line basics, javascript, react and typescript are not required for this task too as you will be guided in this exercise

# Task 3: Display data visually for traders
Technical Communication, Financial Analysis, Web Applications

Being able to access and  adjust data feeds is critical to any trading analysis and stock price monitoring. From the previous tasks, we now have the adjusted data set up on your systems and being piped into Perspective.

For traders to have a complete picture of all the trading strategies being monitored, several screens typically display an assortment of live and historical data at their workstation.

Given there is a lot of information and data being produced at once, visualizing data in a clear manner with UI/UX considerations accounted for is critical to providing traders with the tools to improve their performance.
